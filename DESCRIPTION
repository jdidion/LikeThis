Description: Regular expressions are incredibly powerful tools for text pattern matching
    and manipulation. Many languages provide an operator for regular expression matching,
    generally following the '~' syntax of perl. In keeping with this tradition, LikeThis
    (or "~this" for short) adds the '%~%' infix operator to R.
